The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. 

The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class. The training batches contain the remaining images in random order, but some training batches may contain more images from one class than another. Between them, the training batches contain exactly 5000 images from each class. 



1.(Part-1) Training and Saving Model.ipynb - USE PRE-TRAINED MODEL TO SAVE TIME  -Training and saving the model to be used in part 2.

2.(Part-2) Loading Model & Image Prediction.ipynb - if you did not run part 1 unzip the trained_model.h5 program and place it in the same directory as this file.
Once the cell is ran, the program will ask for an image path. feed in a test image or an image that you downloaded from the internet.

3. Trained_model.h5 - the trained model. place in same directory as part-2. This is the pre-trained model.
